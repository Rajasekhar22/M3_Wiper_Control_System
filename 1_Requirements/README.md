# REQUIREMENTS

##  Feautures
     * Easy in controlling speeds of wiper movement.
     * Turning on/off car on button for 2Sec.
     * controlling speeds using button press count

## Research
    * Referred many research papers on wiper control.
    * Referred many e-sources for coding part.
    * Surfed internet(youtube, google scholar).
       
##  Key feautures
    * Controlling speeds of wiper subsequent key presses.

# The 4W's and a H 

## WHAT
   * It is the process of adjusting the wiper system's speed under various rainy circumstances.
## WHY
  * The main goal of this project is to control the speed of the wiper system in various rainy conditions.
## WHO
  * Windshield wiper's manufacturers/car manufacturers, who require the controlling of wipers on different speeds.
## WHERE
  * This mainly comes in use on Vehicle Windshield glasses.
## HOW
  * This project is implemented using "Embedded C Program" based on ARM Processors/Controllers.

# SWOT ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
 ## STRENGTHS:
    * Easily Operating.
    * Easy controlling of speed's.
 ## WEAKNESS:
    * No sensor based control.
    * Doesn't work properly if there is damage in STM32 board.
 ## THREATS:
    * Failure of operation may lead to Accidents.
